# Message-Encode-Decode

**Message Encoder and Decoder with GUI (Python + Tkinter)**

This project is a simple yet powerful message encoder and decoder implemented in Python with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. With this application, users can encode their messages into a secret code and decode them back to the original text effortlessly. The encoder uses a customizable encryption algorithm to ensure the security of encoded messages.

**Key Features:**
- **User-Friendly GUI:** The application provides a sleek and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to input their messages and navigate the encoding and decoding processes.
- **Customizable Encryption 
- **Efficient Encoding and Decoding:** The encoder quickly converts messages into coded text, and the decoder efficiently translates the encoded text back to the original message.
- **Open-Source and Customizable:** The project's open-source nature allows developers to explore the code, customize the encryption methods, and contribute to its improvement.

**Usage:**
1. **Enter Message:** Input the message you want to encode in the designated text box.
2. **Encode/Decode:** Click the respective buttons to encode or decode the message.
3. **Copy or Save:** Copy the encoded/decoded message to clipboard or save it for future reference.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance the project! Happy encoding and decoding!
